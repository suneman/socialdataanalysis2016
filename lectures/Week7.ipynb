In my opinion this method of slowly building the visualization on your own is much better than downloading pre-baked code from github. Edit the D3 in an editor, and keep your page open in a browser (with developer tools open). That way you can experience how each new bit of code changes your visualization. This strategy takes longer, but will save you time in the long run (because you'll understand everything much better).\n",
