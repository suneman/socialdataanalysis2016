    "Today we make a **major shift** in the direction of the course. We will leave the machine learning behind and start working seriously on the visualization. Each of the last three lectures, we will have two main topics\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start with a short lecture on the principles of visualization - why do we need data visualization and what can we do with it. The lectures are given by [Andrea Cuttone](http://andreacuttone.com) who's a graduate student here at DTU. Andrea's work focuses on the intersection betweeh visualization and machine learning, so he's the right guy for the job. (He's also the author of `geoplotlib`.)\n",
    "* Then we work with our second text book [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345), which is essentially one long tutorial for learning `D3.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ask: \"What? We've just learned Python, and now you want us to learn yet another programming language! Why???\". The answer is that you there is no way around D3 if you're serious about visualizing data. D3 stands for \"Data Driven Documents\" and is the right way to create interactive data visualization in the browser. Have a look at the examples below to get a sense of why D3 is the _de facto_ standard for serious data visualization on the web:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Best demo of time series data _evah_](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/1256572/)\n",
    "* [Tokyo Wind speeds](http://air.nullschool.net)\n",
    "* [Changes in the Electorate in Key States and Regions (New York Times)](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/11/sunday-review/counties-moving.html)\n",
    "* [Political Influence and Campaign Donations](http://www.brightpointinc.com/political_influence/)\n",
    "\n",
    "And knowing D3 is an important skill on the job market. And because there's a great community around D3, it's easy to find help for almost any problem on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/d3.js). \n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. And I know I promised you a rundown of your answers to the questionnaire. I've been insanely busy since last time, so I'll have to get them to you later today (I've started the analysis but not quite done yet)."
